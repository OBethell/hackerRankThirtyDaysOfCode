# Hacker Rank 30 Days Of Code

  To further my coding experience the Hacker Rank 30 Days of Code course was chosen to provide a solid foundation. This foundation would aid 
  in order to produce code for real world projects. The course provides a full overview of coding methods and techniques in objective coding, provided
  along side the course are challenges and tutorial videos. This repository provides all solutions to these challenges written in NetBeans IDE in java.
